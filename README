Manual:

    - puppet file
        my puppet file is named "puppet.lua" and is directly in the
        assginements root folder itself it is NOT in Assets/ folder
        ./puppet.lua

    - Arc Ball
        For the Arcball Manipulation, I referenced
        https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_Arcball

    - Selection
        From the assignment "A joint is selected by clicking on part
        of the geometry immediately beneath it" "Clicking on geometry
        not immediately under a moveable joint should have no effect."

        I followed this exactly, so the joints in my puppet CANNOT be
        selected by clicking on the joint geometry itself. The picking
        has to be on the body part geometry beneath the joint. All joints
        are blue, all geometry are green. Only exception are eyes
        which are geometry and blue.

    - Head Movement
        Continuing with the selection logic before. There is a joint at
        the bottom of the neck, which can be selected by clicking on the
        neck itself, and has 1 degree of freedom.

        There is a joint at the top of the neck, which can be selected by
        clicking on the head, and has two degrees of freedom.

        Up and down movement, which is controlled by middle mouse moving up and down.
        Left and right movement, which is controlled by right mouse moving left and right.

        The actually implementation of the rotation at the head is broken up into the
        upper neck joint and the head geometry to avoid problems when both d.o.f are
        used. But this is hidden from the user.
